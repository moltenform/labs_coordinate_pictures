Also,

* You can specify `jpgHighQualityChromaSampling=True` in img\_convert\_resize.py to save a higher quality jpg file that will better preserve certain details, like red text

* Use Edit->Set Rotation Tag to change or remove the exif rotation marker on a jpg image

* Use Edit->Convert Many Images for batch conversion/resize

* File handles are released quickly; the currently viewed file can be edited and renamed

* img\_convert\_resize.py will pass image data over pipes; it can convert from any image format into a webp without writing a temporary png file

* img\_utils.py contains additional useful methods for working with exif data like see `readThumbnails()`, `readExifCreationTime()`, `removeResolutionTags()`, and `removeAllExifTags()`

* Can be added to Windows context menu, see instructions at the end of the page [here](https://moltenform.com/page/labs-coordinate-pictures/doc/download-and-setup.html)
